For earlier builds - Open your User Global Settings Preferences file `Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences -> Global Settings - User`\r\n* Add (or update) your theme entry to be `\"theme\": \"Soda Light.sublime-theme\"` or `\"theme\": \"Soda Dark.sublime-theme\"`\r\n\r\n### Example User Settings\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        \"theme\": \"Soda Light.sublime-theme\"\r\n    }\r\n\r\n## Bonus Options\r\n\r\n### Syntax Highlighting Colour Schemes\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to use the syntax highlighting schemes shown in the screenshots they are located in the root of the repository: \r\n\r\n* Copy or link the two `tmtheme` files in the Sublime Text 2 `Packages/User` folder\r\n* Enable the colour scheme via `Preferences -> Color Scheme -> User`\r\n\r\n### Code Font\r\n\r\nThe code font shown in the screenshot is Menlo.\r\n\r\n## Release Notes\r\n\r\nSoda theme is designed to work with the latest [development build](http://www.sublimetext.com/dev) of Sublime Text 2. ST2 dev builds move quickly and changes can occur with the theme API between releases, so there may be occassions where the theme doesn't quite work with a brand new dev release.\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\nWhile developing the theme, I have documented some [theme challenges and ideas](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme/wiki/Theme-challenges-and-ideas) encountered along the way.\r\n\r\n## Legals\r\n\r\nThe theme contains some icons from the excellent [Pictos](http://pictos.drewwilson.com/) series by Drew Wilson which I have a license for. Any use of these icons, other than for the purpose of the theme itself, would need to comply with Drew's [icon licensing agreement](http://stockart.drewwilson.com/license/).\r\n","name":"Soda-theme","google":""}
